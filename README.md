# Genomic Analysis of Coronaviruses

This repository contains an R markdown file and its corresponding HTML output, presenting a genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses found in bats and pangolins. The project explores the evolutionary relationships between these viruses and visualizes their nucleotide compositions.

## Files:
- **evidencia2_a01662935.Rmd**: The R markdown file containing the code and analysis.
- **evidencia2_a01662935.html**: The rendered HTML output showing the results, including visualizations.

## Requirements:
To run the R markdown file, ensure you have the following:
- R version 4.0 or higher
- The following R packages:
  - `ggplot2`
  - `dplyr`
  - `phangorn` (for phylogenetic analysis)
  - `knitr`
  - `rmarkdown`

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio or another compatible editor.
3. Install the required packages if necessary.
4. Run the code chunks to generate the phylogenetic trees and nucleotide composition analysis.
5. View the HTML output by opening the `.html` file in your browser.
